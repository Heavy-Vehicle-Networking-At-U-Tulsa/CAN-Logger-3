# CAN Logger 3 - Rev 3d Hardware
The revision 3d hardware had a circuit design flaw in the coin cell battery was connected to the Vbatt of the wifi chip, thus quickly draining the coin cell battery. This made it so the CAN Logger did not accurately keep track of time. 

These boards were reworked to remove that circuit flaw and the result is the revision 3e boards.
