# CAN Logger 3 Hardware Documentation
The CAN Logger 3 was designed with Altium Designer version 19 and 20. The different hardware revisions in this directory contain the original source files for Altium along with:

* Schematics in PDF format
* Bill of Materials to include manufacturer, part number, supplier, and supplier part number. 
* Production Gerber files that contain Pick-n-place information, Gerber plots, NC Drill files, and materials.
* Altium Project files, schematic documents and the PCB file.

There is also information with libraries for parts used in the design file. However, these are likely outdated.

## Additional Hardware
The enclosures are Bud HP-3651-B. Some of the references in the design documents have the 6 and the 5 transposed so the incorrect partnumber is referenced (i.e. HP3561 is wrong, but HP3651B is correct.) The enclosures are available here:

To power the realtime clock, be sure to get coincell batteries. These are BR1225 coin cells and are available from Digi-Key:

You will also need SD Cards. We prefer Samsung Pro Class 10 cards.

The cable to connect to vehicle networks is pinned out according to the DPA4 from DG Tech.

## End Plate Layout
Files are available to cut the end plates to accomodate USB, SD card, DSUB-15 and the LEDs. These will need to be cut or machined for new builds.
