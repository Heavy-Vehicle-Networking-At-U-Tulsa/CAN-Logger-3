# CAN Logger 3 Documentation

## Errata
The original bill of materials uses the ATEEC608A-SSHCZ CryptoAuthentication chip from Microchip. This device is a SOIC 8 chip with single wire communicaitons. However, the schematic has the device connected as an I2C device. This chip should be replaced with the ATEEC608A-SSHDA-T device that used I2C communications.


Programmers must use ask for a non-disclosure agreement to get a data sheet for ATECC608A-SSHDA-T.
